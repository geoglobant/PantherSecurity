# Android Sample (Clean Architecture)

Initial Android project with structure equivalent to iOS (Domain/Data/Presentation) and an SDK stub.

## How to open
1. Open `mobile/android` in Android Studio.
2. Wait for Gradle sync.

## Structure
- `domain/`: entities and use cases
- `data/`: repositories
- `presentation/`: view model
- `sdk/`: PantherSecurity SDK (stub)

## Note
The Android SDK is still a stub and must be connected to the Rust core/FFI later.
